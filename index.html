          Gametime is a startup that provides an easy way to purchase last minute tickets to live entertainment events, whether it may be sports or concerts.
          During my internship as a backend engineer at Gametime, I spent the majority of my efforts working with Go and Mongo to build the Events Generation project (a service that creates the events that are sold on the Gametime app).
          For this project, I also had the opportunity to build an AWS Lambda function using JavaScript, which introduced me to power of serverless computing.
          I also redesigned how ticket configurations and seat locators on tickets were stored in our database, resulting in a more efficient and cleaner data model.

            Working at Sears Holding Coporation meant living and working in a foreign country for the first time and this provided me with an abundance of new challenges and excitement.
            Initially joining the team as a front-end developer for the Sears Commercial internal admin site, I quickly took ownership of the entire project and worked its backend components as well.
            Using <span class="highlight">Ruby on Rails</span> and <span class="highlight">AngularJS</span> as the respective back-end and front-end technologies.
            I also created an ad recognition <span class="highlight">Ruby gem </span>using the <span class="highlight">Tesseract OCR</span> to be used company wide        </div>

              Joining BlackBerry as a QA Analyst showed me a new perspective of software development. I was required to maintain hundreds of test cases for BlackBerry's BBM using
              <span class="highlight"> Git </span> and  <span class="highlight">UTM.</span> In addition, I also oversaw the process of a third party application integration with BlackBerry. Going through a work term of tedious testing definitely allowed me to
              grow as a developer to write and create software with more care and precision.        </div>
